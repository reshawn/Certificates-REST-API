# Certificates REST API
A few simple RESTful endpoints designed as if they were to be consumed by the Verisart front-end app.

- Perform basic CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations on JSON certificate objects stored in the back-end. (static data for the purposes of this task)
- View certificates owned by a user
- Transfer certificate ownership from one user to another, supported by basic authorization.

The documentation below walks through setting up and running the code as well as detailed examples of how to consume the endpoints.

## Setup
### Golang
follow the official [docs](https://golang.org/doc/install) for installation and setup of the development environment
### Project
1. After installing Golang, a GOPATH environment variable should be set.
In the directory "[GOPATH]/src/" unzip these files.
2. Install the project dependencies  
`// These libraries are for routing and handling requests` <br>
`$ go get "github.com/gorilla/mux"`<br>
`$ go get "github.com/gorilla/context"`<br>
`$ go get "github.com/gorilla/handlers"`<br>
3. To run the project locally, run `go run main.go`
4. The API is ready to be opened now! Go to http://localhost:8080 in your browser
(the port can be edited in the main.go file)

### Docker
To run the [published](https://hub.docker.com/r/reshawn/certificates/) docker container, run
` docker run --rm -it -p 8080:8080 reshawn/certificates`

### Running Unit Tests
Change directory to the certificate_logic folder and run `go test`


**Note**: A JSON formatter extension or API development environment like [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/apps) will be useful for trying out the endpoint consumption
